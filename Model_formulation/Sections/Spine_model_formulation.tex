\subsection{Objective function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The basic objective function of the Spine Model is to minimize the total discounted costs. 


The total costs will in the end comprise the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Costs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item investment costs
		\item dismantling costs
		\item fixed O\&M costs
		\item variable O\&M costs
		\item import costs (exogenous commodity flows with a cost attached)
		\item production costs (related to domestic resource production, e.g., extracting oil from oil fields)
		\item taxes and subsidies associated with commodity flows
		\item taxes and subsidies associated with investments
		\item Utility loss following reduced end-use demands
		\item utility losses related to reduced reliability
	\end{itemize}
	\item Revenues:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Salvage value (value of investments beyond the considered model horizon)
		\item export revenues
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\begin{align} \label{eq:objective}
Min_{\vFlow} \quad  TotalCost
\end{align}

\begin{align} \label{eq:objective_definition}
TotalCost = ProductionCost
\end{align}


\begin{align} \label{eq:production_cost}
ProductionCost = \sum_{\timesteps} \Bigg[& \nonumber \\

\subsection{Technological constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Define unit/technology capacity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In a multi-commodity setting, there can be different commodities entering/leaving a certain technology/unit. These can be energy-related commodities (e.g., electricity, natural gas, etc.), emissions, or other commodities (e.g., water, steel). The capacity of the unit must be unambiguously defined based on certain commodity flows (e.g., the capacity of a CHP could be based on the output electricity, the output heat, the sum of both or the input natural gas). 

\begin{align} \label{eq:max_capacity}
&\sum_{\substack{\commodity :  \\ \commodity \in \commoditygroup \\ \OutputCommoditiesUnits}} \vFlow[\commodity, \node, \unit, out, \timestep] + \sum_{\substack{\commodity :  \\  \commodity \in \commoditygroup \\ \InputCommoditiesUnits}} \vFlow[\commodity, \node, \unit, in, \timestep] \nonumber \\
&  \le \nonumber \\
&\pAF \pUnitCapacity \{\vNumberOfUnits or \quad \pNumberOfUnits\} \pUnitConvCapToFlow \nonumber \\
&\forall \quad \timesteps, (\units,\commoditygroups): \pUnitCapacity \text{ is defined}
\end{align}





% {\color{red} DEPRECATED
% Therefore, a group of commodities need to be defined which define the capacity of the unit/technology. This is the so-called 'Capacity defining commodity group' (cdcg)\footnote{In TIMES, this is called the 'Primary commodity group'}, and should be defined by the users (defaults can apply). This capacity thus restricts the flows of the commodities in the Cdcg (similar to TIMES EQ CAPACT).
% \begin{align} \label{eq:max_capacity}
% &\sum_{\substack{\commodity :  \\ \Cdcg \\ \OutputCommoditiesUnits}} \vFlow[\commodity, \node, \unit, out, \timestep] + \sum_{\substack{\commodity :  \\  \Cdcg \\ \InputCommoditiesUnits}} \vFlow[\commodity, \node, \unit, in, \timestep] \nonumber \\
% &  \le \nonumber \\
% &\pAF \pUnitConvCapToFlow \{\vCapacity or \quad \pUnitCapacity\} \quad \forall \quad \units, \timesteps
% \end{align}
% }



\subsubsection{Static and linear relationships between input and output commodity flows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Between the different flows, relationships can be imposed. The most simple relationship is a linear relationship between input and output commodities/commodity groups (TIMES EQ PTRANS). Whenever there is only a single input commodity and a single output commodity, this relationship relates to the notion of an efficiency. This equation can however also be used for instance to relate emissions to input primary fuel flows. In the most general form of the equation, two commodity groups are defined (an input commodity group $cg\_in$ and an output commodity group $cg\_out$)\footnote{The above equations indicate that it might not be so simple as simply defining the value of a number of parameters which either belong to a unit or commodity. The user might also need to specify to which commodity groups different parameters relate.}, and a linear relationship is expressed between both commodity groups. Note that whenever the relationship is specfied between groups of multiple commodities, there remains a degree of freedom regarding the composition of the input commodity flows within group cg1 and the output commodity flows within group cg2. 

\paragraph{Parameter $\pFixRatioOutputInputFlow$: Fixed relationships between output and input flows}
\begin{align} \label{eq:fixratiooutputinputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg\_out} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,out,\timestep] = \pFixRatioOutputInputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg\_in} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg\_out, cg\_in : \pFixRatioOutputInputFlow is defined
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameter $\pMaxRatioOutputInputFlow$: Maximal output flows relative to input flows:}
\begin{align} \label{eq:maxratiooutputinputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg\_out} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,out,\timestep] \le \pMaxRatioOutputInputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg\_in} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg\_out, cg\_in : \pMaxRatioOutputInputFlow is defined
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameter $\pMinRatioOutputInputFlow$: Minimal output flows relative to input flows:}
\begin{align} \label{eq:minratiooutputinputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg\_out} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,out,\timestep] \ge \pMinRatioOutputInputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg\_in} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg\_out, cg\_in : \pMinRatioOutputInputFlow is defined
\end{align}

Additional relationships can further be imposed. Two basic constraints impose a linear relationship between multiple input commodities/commodity groups (Eq.~\eqref{eq:fixratioinputinputflow}-\eqref{eq:maxratioinputinputflow} - similar to (TIMES EQ INSHR)), and a linear relationship between multiple output commodities/commodity groups (Eq.~\eqref{eq:fixratiooutputoutputflow}-\eqref{eq:maxratiooutputoutputflow} - similar to TIMES EQ OUTSHR). These relationships reduce the degrees of freedom. The relationship between different input flows can for instance be used to define a fixed or maximal share of biomass in a coal-fired power plant. The relationship between different output flows can for instance be used to define a relationship between the heat and electrical power outputs of a CHP plant, or to establish relationships between different outputs in an distillery. 

\paragraph{Parameter $\pFixRatioInputInputFlow$: Fixed relationship between multiple input flows}
\begin{align} \label{eq:fixratioinputinputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg2} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] = \pFixRatioInputInputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg1} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg1, cg2: \pFixRatioInputInputFlow is defined
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameter $\pMaxRatioInputInputFlow$: Maximal ratio between multiple input flows}
\begin{align} \label{eq:maxratioinputinputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg2} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \le \pMaxRatioInputInputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg1} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg1, cg2: \pMaxRatioInputInputFlow is defined
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameter $\pFixRatioOutputOutputFlow$: Fixed relationship between multiple output flows}
\begin{align} \label{eq:fixratiooutputoutputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg2} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,outn,\timestep] = \pFixRatioOutputOutputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg1} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,out,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg1, cg2: \pFixRatioOutputOutputFlow is defined
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameter $\pMaxRatioOutputOutputFlow$: Maximal ratio between multiple output flows}
\begin{align} \label{eq:maxratiooutputoutputflow}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg2} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,outn,\timestep] \le \pMaxRatioOutputOutputFlow \sum_{\commodity \in cg1} \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,out,\timestep] \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps, cg1, cg2: \pMaxRatioOutputOutputFlow is defined
\end{align}



The above static relationships represent constraints on the ratios between different commodity flows per unit. Additionally, bounds can be put on the instantaneous or total absolute flows generated by each unit, or even on the instantaneous or total flows from all units together (the latter are no longer technological constraints though).

\subsubsection{Absolute bounds on commodity flows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Different absolute bounds on the flows of a commodity/the commodities within a commodity group can be generated. These bounds can be on the total production (output), consumption or on the net production of a certain commodities. In addition, the bounds can be generated for different dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for a specific unit at a certain moment
	\item for a specific unit over all time steps
	\item for a specific unit, cumulative over different years
	\item for all units within a certain region at a certain moment
	\item for all units within a certain region over all time steps
	\item for all units within a certain region, cumulative over different years
	\item for all units (accross all regions) at a certain moment
	\item for all units (accross all regions) over all time steps
	\item for all units (across all regions), cumulative over different years
\end{enumerate}
Each combination would possible require a different parameter and equation (here only for absolute bounds already 27 in total). This could be strongly reduced by using unit groups and commodity groups (preferably facilitated by having default groups such as for all units, for all timesteps, etc.). {\color{red} Temporal emements still need to be included. I think that the bounds could be specified for timestep groups within a year. For multi-year models, cumulative bounds over different years could be imposed as well.}


 The generic equations constraining the instantaneous production, consumption and net production of commodities respectively then look as follows: 

\paragraph{Parameters $\pFixOutFlowBound$, $\pMaxOutFlowBound$, $\pMinOutFlowBound$: Bound on the instantaneous production:}
\begin{align} \label{eq:outflowbound}
&\sum_{\substack{\commodity \in \commoditygroup, \unit \in \unitgroup, \node \in \nodegroup: \\ \OutputCommoditiesUnitsNodes}} \vFlow[\commodity,\node,\unit,out,\timestep]  \{=;\le;\ge\} \{\pFixOutFlowBound;\pMaxOutFlowBound;\pMinOutFlowBound\} \nonumber \\
&\forall \commoditygroups, \unitgroups, \timesteps : \nonumber \\
&\{\pFixOutFlowBound;\pMaxOutFlowBound;\pMinOutFlowBound\} specified
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameters $\pFixInFlowBound$, $\pMaxInFlowBound$, $\pMinInFlowBound$: Bound on the instantaneous consumption:}
\begin{align} \label{eq:inflowbound}

&\forall \commoditygroups, \unitgroups, \timesteps : \{\pFixInFlowBound ; \pMaxInFlowBound ; \pMinInFlowBound\} specified
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameters $\pFixNetFlowBound$, $\pMaxNetFlowBound$, $\pMinNetFlowBound$: Bound on the instantaneous net production:}
\begin{align} \label{eq:netflowbound}
&\sum_{\substack{\commodity \in \commoditygroup, \unit \in \unitgroup, \node \in \nodegroup: \\ \OutputCommoditiesUnitsNodes}} \vFlow[\commodity,\node,\unit,out,\timestep] - \sum_{\substack{\commodity \in \commoditygroup, \unit \in \unitgroup, \node \in \nodegroup: \\ \InputCommoditiesUnitsNodes}} \vFlow[\commodity,\node,\unit,in,\timestep]  \nonumber \\
&\{=;\le;\ge\} \{\pFixNetFlowBound;\pMaxNetFlowBound;\pMinNetFlowBound\} \nonumber \\
&\forall \commoditygroups, \unitgroups, \timesteps : \{\pFixNetFlowBound;\pMaxNetFlowBound;\pMinNetFlowBound \} specified
\end{align}

 The generic equations constraining the cumulative production, consumption and net production of commodities respectively then look as follows {\color{red} To be refined once the temporal representation is fixed}:

Note that for the commodities correspondong to the units' capacity defining commodity group, a bound on the commodity flows is already generated (restricting flows to the installed capacity) - see Eq.~\eqref{eq:max_capacity} or Eq.~\eqref{eq:maximumoperatingpoint}.

{\color{red} TO ELABORATE

Equations to Check:
\begin{itemize}
	\item EQ ACTBND: relates to bound of the flow of a process for a certain time-slice level which is below or above the time-slice level of the process -> Remains to be seen how the temporal dimension will look like in SPINE
	\item EQ BLND
	\item EQ BNDPRD/NET - Bound on the cumulative net bound of a commodity over a time interval
	\item EQ CUMNET/CUMPRD - to generate a bound on the total cumulative production/net production of a commodity over multiple years - similar to Eq.~\eqref{eq:flowbound}, but cumulative over multiple years -> to do when temporal structure is defined
	\item EQ CUMPRD - used to define the total supply of a commodity in each period and time slice (from all different sources).
	\item EQ FLMRK - market share of a unit in the total production of a commodity (e.g., usefull for reserves)
	\item EQ FLOBND - bound on the absolute flows within a commodity group for a specific unit
	\item EQ FLOFR - used to define load curves in TIMES - I guess this will be done differently in Spine
\end{itemize}
}


{\color{red}
TO DO:
\begin{itemize}
	\item adapt flow relationship or bound equations to changing variable definition
	\item generalize equations to be defined for unit groups rather than individual units
	\item include different types of units (regular, storage, network flows) into the flow relationship or bound equations
	\item the current equations should be represented on different temporal levels (e.g., instantaneous, on annual level, over all years, etc.)
	\item Revisit EQ CUMNET/CUMPRD when the temporal structure is defined.
\end{itemize}
}

(similar to TIMES EQ BNDNET/BNDPRD)





\subsubsection{Dynamic constraints on input and output commodity flows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Ramping constraints} These constraints induce a bound on the rate of change of a flow of certain commodities/commodity groups. The commodity group cg to which the ramping constraint applies needs to be specified.

There are many different possible formulations of ramping constraints. Hence, the equation is dependent on the archetype selected. Below is are two ramping equation versions represented: one for archetypes which do not have commitment variables, and one for archetypes which do have commitment variables

Without commitment variables ({\color{red} Should in principle be based on available rather than total capacity}):
\begin{align} \label{eq:updwardrampingconstraintwithoutcommitmentvariables}
&\sum_{\commodity \in \commoditygroup} \Big( \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in/out,\timestep+1] - \vFlow \Big) \le \pRampRateUp \pUnitCapacity \{\vNumberOfUnits or \quad \pNumberOfUnits\} \pDeltaT \nonumber \\
&\forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}

\begin{align} \label{eq:downdwardrampingconstraintwithoutcommitmentvariables}
&\sum_{\commodity \in \commoditygroup} \Big( \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in/out,\timestep+1] - \vFlow \Big) \le \pRampRateDown \pUnitCapacity \{\vNumberOfUnits or \quad \pNumberOfUnits\}\pDeltaT \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}



With commitment variables:
\begin{align} \label{eq:updwardrampingconstraintwithcommitmentvariables}
\sum_{\commodity \in cg} \Big( \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in/out,\timestep+1] - \vFlow \Big) \le & (\vUnitsOnline-\vUnitsShuttingDown) \pRampRateUp \pUnitCapacity \pDeltaT \nonumber \\
& - \vUnitsShuttingDown \pMinimumOperatingPoint \nonumber \\
& +\vUnitsStartingUp \pMaxStartUpPower \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}

\begin{align} \label{eq:downdwardrampingconstraintwithcommitmentvariables}
\sum_{\commodity \in cg} \Big( \vFlow - \vFlow[\commodity,\unit,in/out,\timestep+1] \Big) \le &(\vUnitsOnline-\vUnitsShuttingDown) \pRampRateDown \pUnitCapacity \pDeltaT \nonumber \\
& - \vUnitsStartingUp \pMinimumOperatingPoint \nonumber \\
& + \vUnitsShuttingDown \pMaxShutDownPower \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}






\subsubsection{Commitment-related constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For modeling certain technologies/units, it is important to not only have flow variables of different commodities, but also model the on/off ("commitment") status of the unit/technology at every time step. Therefore, an additional variable $\vUnitsOnline$ is introduced. This variable represents the number of online units of that technology (for a normal unit commitment model, this variable might be a binary, for investment planning purposes, this might also be an integer or even a continuous variable - this will depend on the archetype of the unit.)

Commitment variables will be introduced by the following constraints (with corresponding parameters):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minimum operating point ($\pMinimumOperatingPoint$)
	\item Minimum up time ($\pMinimumUpTime$)
	\item Minimum down time ($\pMinimumDownTime$)
	\item Certain ramp-rate formulations depending on the archetype ($\pRampRateUp$, $\pRampRateDown$)
\end{itemize}

Additionally, start-up and shut-down variables might need to be introduced for modeling start-up costs, minimum up time and minimum down-time constraints.

Whenever commitment variables are introduced, the capacity constraint (Eq.~\eqref{eq:max_capacity}) needs to be redefined:
\begin{align} \label{eq:maximumoperatingpoint}
&\sum_{\commodity : \commodity \in \commoditygroup} \vFlow \le \vUnitsOnline \pUnitCapacity \nonumber \\
&\forall \quad \timesteps, (\units, \commoditygroups): \pUnitCapacity \text{ is defined}
\end{align}

Additionally, the number of online units need to be restricted to the installed and available capacity:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:maximumonlineunits}
\vUnitsOnline \le \vUnitsAvailable \quad \forall \quad \units, \timesteps
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:availableunits}
\vUnitsAvailable \le \pAF \{\vNumberOfUnits or \quad \pNumberOfUnits\} \quad \forall \quad \units, \timesteps
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Minimum operating point}
A first commitment-related constraint is the minimal operating point of an online unit. The minimum operating point can be based on the flows of input or output commodities/commodity groups cg ({\color{red}
Is this always for the capacity defining commodity group, or are there instances where a minimum operating point is defined for other commodities/commodity groups?} See example below, if reserve capacity and electrical power together form the Cdcg of a coal-fired power plant, than the Cdcg should not be used here):
\begin{align} \label{eq:minimumoperatingpoint}
&\sum_{\commodity \in cg} \vFlow \ge \pMinimumOperatingPoint \vUnitsOnline \pUnitCapacity \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}

{\color{red} To check: how to approach the installed capacity - this can be a parameter or a variable (or both) dependending on the problem?}


\paragraph{Minimum up time}
\begin{align} \label{eq:minimumuptime}
&\vUnitsShuttingDown \le \vUnitsOnline - \sum_{\timestep'=1}^{\pMinimumUpTime - 1} \vUnitsStartingUp[\unit,\timestep-\timestep'] \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}
{\color{red} This is the basic constraint. However, whenever non-spinning downward reserves are considered, an additional term which represents 'the units available to shut down in order to provide downward reserves' needs to be added to the left-hand side of the equation. How to deal with this in a generic way?}

\paragraph{Minimum down time}
\begin{align} \label{eq:minimumdowntime}
&\vUnitsStartingUp \le \vUnitsAvailable - \vUnitsOnline - \sum_{\timestep'=1}^{\pMinimumDownTime - 1} \vUnitsShuttingDown[\unit,\timestep-\timestep'] \nonumber \\
& \forall \units, \timesteps
\end{align}
{\color{red} This is the basic constraint. However, whenever non-spinning upward reserves are considered, an additional term which represents 'the units available to start up in order to provide upward reserves' needs to be added to the left-hand side of the equation. How to deal with this in a generic way?}
