  abstract = {This work analyzes different modeling methodologies for balancing the electricity supply sources and the electricity demand in systems with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and run-of-river hydro. This work also explores the reasons and the circumstances where common balance approaches used by mid- and long-term energy models show significant differences in dispatched renewable sources, overestimating the renewable share in the electricity mix and underestimating the amount of \{CO2\} emitted by the electric system, when compared to balance methods with high time resolution. These reasons and circumstances are illustrated for the Flores island (Azores) case study which has already achieved a share of 50% of renewable energies in electricity production in 2009.},

title="Reducing computing time of energy system models by a myopic approach",

number="1",
pages="65--83",
abstract="In this paper, the performance of the existing energy system model PERSEUS-NET is improved in terms of computing time. Therefore, the possibility of switching from a perfect foresight to a myopic approach has been implemented. PERSEUS-NET is a linear optimization model generating scenarios of the future German electricity generation system until 2030, whilst considering exogenous regional characteristics such as electricity demand and existing power plants as well as electricity transmission network restrictions. Up to now, the model has been based on a perfect foresight approach, optimizing all variables over the whole time frame in a single run, thus determining the global optimum. However, this approach results in long computing times due to the high complexity of the problem. The new myopic approach splits the optimization into multiple, individually smaller, optimization problems each representing a 5 year period. The change within the generation system in each period is determined by optimizing the subproblem, whilst taking into account only the restrictions of that particular period. It was found that the optimization over the whole time frame with the myopic approach takes less than one tenth of the computing time of the perfect foresight approach. Therefore, we analyse in this paper the advantages and draw-backs of a change in the foresight as a way of reducing the complexity of energy system models. For PERSEUS-NET it is found that the myopic approach with stable input parameters is as suitable as the perfect foresight approach to generate consistent scenarios, with the advantage of significantly less computing time.",

    abstract = { We cast models of the generation capacity expansion type formally developed for the monopoly regime into equilibrium models better adapted for a competitive environment. We focus on some of the risks faced today by investors in generation capacity and thus pose the problem as a stochastic equilibrium model. We illustrate the approach on the problem of the incentive to invest. Agents can be risk neutral or risk averse. We model risk aversion through the CVaR of plants' profit. The CVaR induces risk-adjusted probabilities according to which investors value their plants. The model is formulated as a complementarity problem (including the CVaR valuation of investments). An illustration is provided on a small problem that captures several features of today's electricity world: a choice often restricted to coal and gas units, a peaky load curve because of wind penetration, uncertain fuel prices, and an evolving carbon market. We assess the potential of the approach by comparing energy-only and capacity market organizations in this risky environment. Our results can be summarized as follows: a deterministic analysis overlooks some changes of capacity structure induced by risk, whether in the capacity market or energy-only organizations. The risk-neutral analysis also misses a shift towards less capital-intensive technologies that may result from risk aversion. Last, risk aversion also increases the shortage of capacity compared to the risk-neutral view in the energy-only market when the price cap is low. This may have a dramatic impact on the bill to the final consumer. The approach relies on mathematical programming techniques and can be extended to full-size problems. The results are illustrative and may deserve more investigation. }

number="1",
pages="91--120",
abstract="Complementarity models can represent the simultaneous optimization problems of one or several interacting decision-makers, and thus they have become an increasingly important and powerful tool for formulating and solving bottom-up energy market models. This paper provides an overview of the full range of complementarity-based formulations and how these can be applied to assist the different market participants and organizations with their decision-making processes. To this end, the first part of the paper introduces the mathematical formulation of some basic complementarity models, which are illustrated by highly simplified but illustrative energy market applications. Considering these models, the second part of the paper is devoted to describing in broad terms four areas of their potential application: electricity markets, emission markets, natural gas markets and economies comprising several interacting markets.",

abstract="The inception of the emission trading scheme in Europe has contributed to power price increases. Energy intensive industries have reacted by arguing that this may affect their competitiveness and will induce them to leave Europe. Taking up a proposal of these industrial sectors, we explore the possible application of special contracts, where electricity is sold at average generation cost to mitigate the impact of CO2 cost on power prices. The model supposes fixed generation capacities. We first consider a reference model representing a perfectly competitive market where all consumers (industries and the rest of the market) are price-takers and buy electricity at short-run marginal cost. We then change the market design by assuming that energy intensive industries pay power either at a regional or at a zonal average cost price. The analysis is conducted with simulation models applied to the Central Western European power market. The models are implemented in GAMS/PATH.",
