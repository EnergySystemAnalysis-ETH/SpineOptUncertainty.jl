The `weight` variable, defined for a [temporal_block](@ref) object can be used to assign different weights to different temporal periods that are modeled. It basically determines how important a certain temporal period is in the total cost, as it enters the [Objective](@ref) function. The main use of this parameter is for representative periods, where each representative period represents a specific fraction of a year or so.
