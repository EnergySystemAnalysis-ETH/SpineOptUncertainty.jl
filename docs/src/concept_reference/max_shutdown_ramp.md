The definition of the `max_shutdown_ramp` parameter will trigger the creation of the [constraint on maximum shutdown ramp](@ref constraint_max_shut_down_ramp). It sets a lower bound on the [unit\_flow](@ref) variable the timestep right before a shutdown.

It can be defined for [unit__to_node](@ref) or [unit__from_node](@ref) relationships, as well as their counterparts for node groups. It will then impose restrictions on the `unit_flow` variables that indicate flows between the two members of the relationship for which the parameter is defined. The parameter is given as a fraction of the [unit\_capacity](@ref) parameter. When the parameter is not included, the aforementioned constraint will not be created, which is equivalent to choosing a value of 1.
