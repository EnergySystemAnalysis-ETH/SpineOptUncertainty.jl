The [connection\_\_investment\_stochastic\_structure](@ref) relationship defines the [stochastic\_structure](@ref)
of [connection](@ref)-related investment decisions.
Essentially, it sets the [stochastic\_structure](@ref) used by the [connections\_invested\_available](@ref) variable of the [connection](@ref).

The [connection\_\_investment\_stochastic\_structure](@ref) relationship uses the
[model\_\_default\_investment\_stochastic\_structure](@ref) relationship if not defined.
