The definition of the fix\_ratio\_in\_in\_unit\_flow parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_fix_ratio_in_in_unit_flow`](#Fixed-ratio-between-input-and-input-unit-flows) and fixes the ratio between incoming flows of a unit. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where both nodes (or group of nodes) in this relationship represent `from_node`s, i.e. the incoming flows to the unit. This parameter can be useful, for instance if a unit requires a specific commodity mix as a fuel supply.
To enforce e.g. for a unit `u` a fixed share of `0.8` of its incoming flow from the node `supply_fuel_1` compared to its incoming flow from the node group `supply_fuel_2` (consisting of the two nodes `supply_fuel_2_component_a` and `supply_fuel_2_component_b`) the [fix\_ratio\_in\_in\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `0.8` for the relationship `u__supply_fuel_1__supply_fuel_2`.
