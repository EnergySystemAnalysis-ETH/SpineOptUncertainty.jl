`unit__unit_constraint` is a two-dimensional relationship between a [unit](@ref) and a [unit_constraint](@ref). The relationship specifies that a variable or variable(s) associated only with the unit (not a `unit_flow` for example) are involved in the constraint. For example, the [units\_on\_coefficient](@ref) defined on `unit__unit_constraint` specifies the coefficient of the [unit](@ref)'s `units_on` variable in the specified [unit_constraint](@ref).
