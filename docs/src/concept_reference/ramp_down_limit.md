The definition of the `ramp_down_limit` parameter will trigger the creation of the [Constraint on spinning downward ramps](@ref). It will limit the maximum decrease in the [unit_flow](@ref Variables) variable between two consecutive timesteps for which the unit is online.

It can be defined for [unit__to_node](@ref) or [unit__from_node](@ref) relationships, as well as their counterparts for node groups. It will then impose restrictions on the `unit_flow` variables that indicate flows between the two members of the relationship for which the parameter is defined. The parameter is given as a fraction of the [unit\_capacity](@ref) parameter. When the parameter is not included, the aforementioned constraint will not be created, which is equivalent to choosing a value of 1.
