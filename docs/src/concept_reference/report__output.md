The [report\_\_output](@ref) relationship tells which [output](@ref) [variables](@ref Variables) to include
in which [report](@ref) when writing *SpineOpt* output.
Without any defined [report\_\_output](@ref) relationships, *SpineOpt* doesn't write any output,
so be sure to include at least one [report](@ref) connected to all the [output](@ref) [variables](@ref Variables) of interest!
