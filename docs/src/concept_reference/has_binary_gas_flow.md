This parameter is necessary for the use of pressure driven gas transfer, for which the direction of flow is not known a priori. The parameter [has\_binary\_gas\_flow](@ref) is a booelean method parameter, which - when set to [true](@ref boolean_value_list) - triggers the generation of the binary variables [binary\_gas\_connection\_flow](@ref), which (together with the [big\_m](@ref) parameter) forces the average flow through a pipeline to be unidirectional.
