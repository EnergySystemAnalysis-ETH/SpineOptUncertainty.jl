This parameter defines how much the optimization window rolls forward in a rolling horizon optimization and should be expressed as a duration. In a rolling horizon optimization, a (small) part of the model is optimized at each iteration, after which the window rolls forward to optimize a different part. Overlap between consecutive optimization windows is possible. In the practical approaches presented in [Temporal Framework](@ref), the rolling window optimization will be explained in more detail. The default value of this parameter is the entire model time horizon, which leads to a single optimization for the entire time horizon.
