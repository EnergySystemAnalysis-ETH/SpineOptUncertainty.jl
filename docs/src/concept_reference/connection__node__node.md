`connection__node__node` is a three-dimensional relationship between a [connection](@ref), a [node](@ref) (node 1) and another [node](@ref) (node 2). `connection__node__node` infers a conversion and a direction with respect to that conversion. Node 1 is assumed to be the input node and node 2 is assumed to be the output node. For example, the [fix\_ratio\_out\_in\_connection\_flow](@ref) parameter defined on `connection__node__node` relates the output `connection_flow` to node 2 to the intput `connection_flow` from node 1
