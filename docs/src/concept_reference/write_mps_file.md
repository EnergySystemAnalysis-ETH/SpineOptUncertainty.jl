This parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

This parameter controls when to write a diagnostic model file in MPS format. If set to `write_mps_always`, the model will always be written in MPS format to the current directory. If set to `write\_mps\_on\_no\_solve`, the MPS file will be written when the model solve terminates with a status of false.  If set to `write\_mps\_never`, no file will be written
