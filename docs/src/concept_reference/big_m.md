The [big\_m](@ref) parameter is a property of the [model](@ref) object.
The bigM method is commonly used for the purpose of recasting non-linear constraints into a mixed-integer reformulation.
In SpineOpt, the bigM formulation is used to describe the sign of gas flow through a connection (if a pressure driven gas transfer model is used). The [big\_m](@ref) parameter in combination with the binary variable [binary\_gas\_connection\_flow](@ref) is used in the constraints on [the gas flow capacity](@ref constraint_connection_flow_gas_capacity) and [the fixed node pressure points](@ref constraint_fixed_node_pressure_point) and ensures that the average flow through a pipeline is only in one direction and is constraint by the fixed pressure points from the outer approximation of the Weymouth equation.
