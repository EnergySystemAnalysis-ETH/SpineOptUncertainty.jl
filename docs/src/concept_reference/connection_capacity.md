Defines the upper bound on the corresponding `connection_flow` variable. If the connection is a candidate connection, the effective `connection_flow` upper bound is the product of the investment variable, `connections_invested_available` and `connection_capacity`. If ptdf based dc load flow is enabled, `connection_capacity` represents the normal rating of a `connection` (line) while [connection\_emergency\_capacity](@ref) represents the maximum post contingency flow.
