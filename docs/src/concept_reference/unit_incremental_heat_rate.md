Used to implement simple or piecewise linear incremental heat rate functions. Used in the constraint [unit\_pw\_heat\_rate](@ref constraint_unit_pw_heat_rate) - the input fuel flow at node 1 is the sum of the electrical MW output at node 2 times the incremental heat rate over all heat rate segments, plus the [unit\_idle\_heat\_rate](@ref). The units are detmerined by the data, but generally, incremental heat rates are given in GJ/MWh. Note that the formulation assumes a convex, monitonically increasing heat rate function. The formulation relies on optimality to load the heat rate segments in the correct order and no additional integer variables are created to enforce the correct loading order. The heat rate segment MW operating points are defined by [operating\_points](@ref).

To implement a simple incremental heat rate function,`unit_incremental_heat_rate` should be given as a simple scalar representing the incremental heat rate over the entire operating range of the unit. To implement a piecewise linear heat rate function, `unit_incremental_heat_rate` should be specified as an array type. It is then used in conjunction with the [unit](@ref) parameter [operating\_points](@ref) which should also be defined as an array type of equal dimension. When defined as an array type `unit_incremental_heat_rate`[i] is the effective incremental heat rate between [operating\_points](@ref) [i-1] \(or zero if i=1\) and [operating\_points](@ref)[i]. Note that [operating\_points](@ref) is defined on a capacity-normalized basis so if [operating\_points](@ref) is specified as [0.5, 1], this creates two operating segments, one from zero to 50% of the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref) and a second from 50% to 100% of the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref).
