This parameter specifies the resolution of the temporal block, or in other words: the length of the timesteps used in the optimization run. Generally speaking, variables and constraints are generated for each timestep of an optimization. For example, the nodal balance constraint must hold for each timestep.

An array of duration values can be used to have a resolution that varies with time itself. It can for example be used when uncertainty in one of the inputs rises as the optimization moves away from the model start. Think of a forecast of for instance wind power generation, which might be available in quarter hourly detail for one day in the future, and in hourly detail for the next two days. It is possible to take a quarter hourly resolution for the full horizon of three days. However, by lowering the temporal resolution after the first day, the computational burden is lowered substantially.
