# Object Classes

TODO: Briefly explain whan an `ObjectClass` is, and what they are supposed to represent in *SpineOpt*.


## `commodity`

A good or product that can be consumed, produced, traded. E.g., electricity, oil, gas, water...

## `connection`

A transfer of commodities between nodes. E.g. electricity line, gas pipeline...

## `model`

An instance of SpineOpt, that specifies general parameters such as the temporal horizon.

## `node`

A universal aggregator of commodify flows over units and connections, with storage capabilities.

## `output`

A variable name from SpineOpt that can be included in a report.

## `report`

A results report from a particular SpineOpt run, including the value of specific variables.

## `stochastic_scenario`

A scenario for stochastic optimisation in SpineOpt.

## `stochastic_structure`

A group of stochastic scenarios that represent a structure.

## `temporal_block`

A length of time with a particular resolution.

## `unit`

A conversion of one/many comodities between nodes.

## `unit_constraint`

A constraint over the flows of a specific unit.
