The definition of the fix\_ratio\_in\_out\_unit\_flow parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_fix_ratio_in_out_unit_flow`](#Fixed-ratio-between-input-and-output-unit) and fixes the ratio between incoming and outgoing flows of a unit. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where the first node (or group of nodes, see ...) in this relationship represents the `from_node`, i.e. the incoming flows to the unit, and the second node (or group of nodes), represents the `to_node` i.e. the outgoing flow from the unit,  .
To enforce e.g. a fixed ratio of `1.4` for a unit `u` between its incoming gas flow from the node `ng` and its outgoing gas flow to the node group `el_heat` (consisting of the two nodes `el` and `heat`), the [fix\_ratio\_in\_out\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `1.4` for the relationship `u__ng__el_heat`.
