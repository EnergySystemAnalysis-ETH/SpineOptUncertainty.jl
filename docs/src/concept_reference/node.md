The [node](@ref) is perhaps the most important `object class` out of the [Systemic object classes](@ref),
as it is what connects the rest together via the [Systemic relationship classes](@ref).
Essentially, [node](@ref)s act as points in the modelled [commodity](@ref) network
where [commodity](@ref) balance is enforced via the [Nodal balance](@ref) and [Node injection](@ref) constraints,
tying together the inputs and outputs from [unit](@ref)s and [connection](@ref)s.
Furthermore, [node](@ref) play a crucial role for defining the temporal and stochastic structures of the [model](@ref)
via the [node\_\_temporal\_block](@ref) and [node\_\_stochastic\_structure](@ref) relationships.
For more details about the [Temporal Framework](@ref) and the [Stochastic Framework](@ref), please refer to the
dedicated sections.
