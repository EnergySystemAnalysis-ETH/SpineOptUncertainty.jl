`model__default_investment_temporal_block` is a two-dimensional relationship between a [model](@ref) and a [temporal_block](@ref). This relationship defines the default temporal resolution and scope for all investment decisions in the model ([units](@ref), [connections](@ref) and storages). Specifying `model__default_investment_temporal_block` for a model avoids the need to specify individual [node__investment_temporal_block](@ref), [unit__investment_temporal_block](@ref) and [connection__investment_temporal_block](@ref) relationships. Convesely, if any of these individual relationships are defined (e.g. [connection__investment_temporal_block](@ref)) along with [model__temporal_block](@ref), these will override [model__default_investment_temporal_block](@ref).
