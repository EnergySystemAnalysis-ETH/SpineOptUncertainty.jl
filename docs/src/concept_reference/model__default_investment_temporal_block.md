`model__default_investment_temporal_block` is a two-dimensional relationship between a [model](@ref) and a [temporal_block](@ref). This relationship defines the default temporal resolution and scope for all investment decisions in the model ([units](@ref unit), [connections](@ref connection) and storages). Specifying `model__default_investment_temporal_block` for a model avoids the need to specify individual [node\_\_investment\_temporal\_block](@ref), [unit\_\_investment\_temporal\_block](@ref) and [connection\_\_investment\_temporal\_block](@ref) relationships. Conversely, if any of these individual relationships are defined (e.g. [connection\_\_investment\_temporal\_block](@ref)) along with [model\_\_temporal\_block](@ref), these will override [model\_\_default\_investment\_temporal\_block](@ref).
