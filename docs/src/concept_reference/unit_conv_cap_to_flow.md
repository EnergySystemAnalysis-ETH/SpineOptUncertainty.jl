The `unit_conv_cap_to_flow`, as defined for a [unit\_\_to\_node](@ref) or [unit\_\_from\_node](@ref), allows the user to align between [flow](@ref Variables) and the [unit_capacity](@ref) parameter, which may be expressed in different units. An example would be when the `unit_capacity` is expressed in GWh, while the demand on the node is expressed in MWh. In that case, a `unit_conv_cap_to_flow` parameter of 1000 would be applicable.
