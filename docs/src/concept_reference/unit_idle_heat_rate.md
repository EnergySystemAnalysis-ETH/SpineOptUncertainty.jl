Used to implement the no-load or idle heat rate of a unit. This is the y-axis offset of the heat rate function and is the fuel consumed per unit time when a unit is online and that results in no additional output. This is defined on the `unit__node__node` relationship and it is assumed that the input flow from node 1 represents fuel consumption and the output flow to node 2 is the elecrical output. While the units depend on the data, `unit_idle_heat_rate` is generally expressed in GJ/hr. Used in conjunction with [unit\_incremental\_heat\_rate](@ref). `unit_idle_heat_rate` is only currently considered if [unit\_incremental\_heat\_rate](@ref) is specified. A trivial [unit\_incremental\_heat\_rate](@ref) of zero can be defined if there is no incremental heat rate.
