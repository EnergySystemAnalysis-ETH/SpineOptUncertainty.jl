The binary flow of a gas pipelines for pressure driven gas transfer is enables through the binary variable [binary\_gas\_connection\_flow](@ref Variables) and the [bigM](@ref) constant.
To fix this binary variable, i.e. pre-define the direction of gas through the pipelines, the [fix\_binary\_gas\_connection\_flow](@ref) parameter can be used.
