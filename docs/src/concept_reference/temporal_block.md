A temporal block defines the temporal properties of the optimization that is to be solved in the current window. It is the key building block of the [Temporal Framework](@ref). Most importantly, it holds the necessary information about the resolution and horizon of the optimization. A single model can have multiple temporal blocks, which is one of the main sources of temporal flexibility in Spine: by linking different parts of the model to different temporal blocks, a single model can contain aspects that are solved with different temporal resolutions or time horizons.
