The `model__temporal_block` relationship is used to determine which [temporal_blocks](@ref temporal_block) are included in a specific model. Note that defining this relationship does not yet imply that any element of the model will be governed by the specified `temporal_block`, for this to happen additional relationships have to be defined such as the [model\_\_default\_temporal\_block](@ref) relationship.
