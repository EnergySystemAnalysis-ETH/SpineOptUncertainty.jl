The definition of the max\_ratio\_out\_out\_unit\_flow parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_max_ratio_out_out_unit_flow`](@ref ratio_out_out) and sets an upper bound on the ratio between outgoing flows of a unit. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where the nodes (or group of nodes) in this relationship represent the `to_node`'s', i.e. outgoing flow from the unit.
To enforce a maximum ratio between two products of a unit `u`, e.g. setting the maximum share of produced electricity flowing to node `el`  to `0.4` of the production of heat flowing to node `heat`, the [fix\_ratio\_out\_out\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `0.4` for the relationship `u__el__heat`.
