For the MILP representation of pressure driven gas transfer, we use an outer approximation approach as described by [Schwele et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2019.8810632). The Weymouth equation is approximated around fixed pressure points, as described by the constraint on [fixed node pressure points](@ref constraint_fixed_node_pressure_point), constraining the average flow in each direction dependent on the adjacent node pressures.
The first fixed pressure constant, which will be multiplied with the pressure of the origin node, is represented by an Array value of the [fixed\_pressure\_constant\_1](@ref).
The second pressure constant corresponds to the related parameter [fixed\_pressure\_constant\_0](@ref).
Note that the [fixed\_pressure\_constant\_1](@ref) parameter should be defined on a [connection\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) relationship, for which the first node corresponds to the origin node, while the second node corresponds to the destination node. For a typical gas pipeline, the will be a [fixed\_pressure\_constant\_1](@ref)  for both directions of flow.
