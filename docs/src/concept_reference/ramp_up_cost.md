By defining the ramp\_up\_cost parameter for a specific unit `u`, node `n`, and direction `d`, a cost term will be added to the objective function whenever an asset (characterized by these indices) ramps up its activity (e.g., when the power generated by a generation unit increases from one time step to another) over the course of the operational dispatch during the current optimization window.
