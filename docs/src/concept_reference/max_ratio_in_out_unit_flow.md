The definition of the [max\_ratio\_in\_out\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_max_ratio_in_out_unit_flow`](@ref ratio_in_out) and sets an upper bound on the ratio between incoming and outgoing flows of a unit. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where the first node (or group of nodes) in this relationship represents the `from_node`, i.e. the incoming flows to the unit, and the second node (or group of nodes), represents the `to_node` i.e. the outgoing flow from the unit.
To enforce e.g. a maximum ratio of `1.4` for a unit `u` between its incoming gas flow from the node `ng` and its outgoing flow to the node group `el_heat` (consisting of the two nodes `el` and `heat`), the [max\_ratio\_in\_out\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `1.4` for the relationship `u__ng__el_heat`.
