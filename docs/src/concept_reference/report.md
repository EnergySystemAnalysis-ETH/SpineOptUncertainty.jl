A [report](@ref) is essentially a group of [output](@ref)s from a [model](@ref),
that gets written into the output database as a result of running *SpineOpt*.
Note that unless appropriate [model\_\_report](@ref) and [report\_\_output](@ref) relationships are defined,
*SpineOpt* doesn't write any output!
