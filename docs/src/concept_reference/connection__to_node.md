`connection__to_node` is a two-dimensional relationship between a [connection](@ref) and a [node](@ref) and implies a `connection_flow` from the [connection](@ref) to the [node](@ref). Specifying such a relationship will give rise to a `connection_flow_variable` with indices `connection=connection, node=node, direction=:to_node`. Relationships defined on this relationship will generally apply to this specific flow variable. For example, [connection_capacity](@ref) will apply only to this specific flow variable, unless the connection parameter [connection_type](@ref) is specified.
