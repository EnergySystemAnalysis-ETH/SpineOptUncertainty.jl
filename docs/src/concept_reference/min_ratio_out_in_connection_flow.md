The definition of the [min\_ratio\_out\_in\_connection\_flow](@ref) parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_min_ratio_out_in_connection_flow`](@ref constraint_ratio_out_in_connection_flow) and sets a lower bound on the ratio between outgoing and incoming flows of a connection. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [connection\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where the first node (or group of nodes) in this relationship represents the `to_node`, i.e. the outgoing flow from the connection, and the second node (or group of nodes), represents the `from_node`, i.e. the incoming flows to the connection.

Note that the ratio can also be defined for [connection\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) relationships, where one or both of the nodes correspond to node groups in order to impose a ratio on aggregated connection flows.

To enforce e.g. a minimum ratio of `0.2` for a connection `conn` between its outgoing electricity flow to [node](@ref) `commodity1` and its incoming flows from the node [node](@ref) `commodity2`, the [min\_ratio\_out\_in\_connection\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `0.8` for the relationship `conn__commodity1__commodity2`.
