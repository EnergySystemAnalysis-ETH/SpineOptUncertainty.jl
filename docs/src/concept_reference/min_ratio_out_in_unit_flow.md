The definition of the min\_ratio\_out\_in\_unit\_flow parameter triggers the generation of the [`constraint_min_ratio_out_in_unit_flow`](#Minimum-ratio-between-output-and-input-unit-flows) and corresponds to a lower bound of the ratio between out and incoming flows of a unit. The parameter is defined on the relationship class [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref), where the first node (or group of nodes) in this relationship represents the `to_node`, i.e. the outgoing flow from the unit, and the second node (or group of nodes), represents the `from_node`, i.e. the incoming flows to the unit.
To enforce e.g. a minimum ratio of `0.8` for a unit `u` between its incoming gas flow from `ng` and its outgoing flows to the node group `el_heat` (consisting of the two nodes `el` and `heat`) the [min\_ratio\_out\_in\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter would be set to `0.8` for the relationship `u__el_heat__ng`.
