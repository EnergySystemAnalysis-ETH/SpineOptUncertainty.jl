## Imposing a limit on renewable production
## Limiting the cumulated flow of a unit group by an absolute value
In the current landscape of energy systems modeling, especially in investment models, it is a common idea to implement a lower limit on the amount of electricity that is generated by renewable sources. SpineOpt allows the user to implement such restrictions by means of the [min\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref) parameter. Which will trigger the creation of the [constraint\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow](@ref constraint_total_cumulated_unit_flow).

Let's take a look at a simple example to see how this works. Suppose that we have a system with only one node, which represents the demand for electricity, and two units: a wind farm, and a conventional gas unit. To connect the wind farm to the electricity node, the [unit\_\_to\_node](@ref) relationship has to be defined.

One can then simply define the [min\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref) parameter for the 'wind_farm__to_electricity_node' relationship to impose a lower bound on the total generation origination from the wind farm.

Note that the value of this parameter is expected to be given as an absolute value, thus care has to be taken to make sure that the units match with the ones used for the [unit\_flow](@ref) variable.

The main source of flexibility in the use of this constraint lies in the possibility to define the parameter for relationships that link 'node_groups' and/or 'unit_groups'. For example, by grouping multiple units that are considered renewable sources (e.g. PV, and wind), targets can be implemented across multiple renewable sources. Similarly, by defining multiple electricity nodes, generation targets can be spatially disagreggated.
