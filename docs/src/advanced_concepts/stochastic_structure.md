# Stochastic Framework

TODO: Explain the logic behind the `stochastic_structure` generation, and how they can be used to create
different interlinked stochastic frameworks.
Basically take the explanation from the wiki, put it here, and clear up some of the terminology so that there
are no conflics between this section and the code.
