# Documentation

The documentation is mostly build with regular [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/). `make.jl` is therefore the main file for building the documentation. However, there are a few convenience functions which automate some parts of the process. Some of these are located close to the documentation (e.g. SPINEOPT.jl/docs/src/mathematical\_formulation/write\_documentation\_sets\_and\_variables.jl) while other functions are inherently part of the SpineOpt code (e.g. SPINEOPT.jl/src/util/docs\_util.jl).
