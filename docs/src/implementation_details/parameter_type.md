# Parameter type

At first glance the type of `ratio[(unit=u, node1=ng1, node2=ng2, stochastic_scenario=s, analysis_time=t0, t=t)]` (from SPINEOPT.jl/src/constraints/constraint\_ratio\_unit\_flow.jl) can be confusing. The square brackets would suggest that ratio is a vector. When you call ratio(unit=u,node1=ng1, node2=ng2), you get a number, as it should be. Furthermore there is ratio.name, which would suggests that ratio is of structure type.

The truth is that ratio is of Parameter type. You can find the definition in SpineInterface.jl/src/types.jl. Also, if you look at SpineInterface.jl/src/base.jl you will see that we implement Base.getindex for the Parameter type. The julia parser 'converts' x\[y\] to Base.getindex(x, y) as you may know. So when we write ratio\[something\] in our constraint code, we are actually calling Base.getindex(ratio, something). Now if you look at the definition of Base.getindex for Parameter in SpineInterface.jl/src/base.jl, you will see that we return a special object of type Call. The Call object is able to remember the parameter and the namedtuple it was called with. This is what allows SpineOpt models to update themselves automatically as the model rolls. By building constraints and objective with Call objects instead of just numbers, we are able to reevaluate the Calls after the model rolls and retrieve the new values.
