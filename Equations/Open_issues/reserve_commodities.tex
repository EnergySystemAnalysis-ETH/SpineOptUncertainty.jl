\subsection{Treatment of reserve commodities}

\paragraph{Description of the issue:} For generality, reserves can be modeled as commodities which are not different from any other commodity. However, the provision of reserves is constrained by highly specific constraints, which are different from most other commodities. Fitting the reserve-related constraints to a generic format might complicate things making the model less transparent and user friendly. Another option would therefore be to have commodity attributes to indicate whether a certain commodity is a reserve commodity (and even more so, whether it is an upward/downward and spinning/non-spinning reserve commodity). While this is easier from a user perspective, it also implies that the specific equations are not availble to other problems (whether these equations would ever be used for other problems remains to be seen)


\paragraph{1: Reserve commodities as a generic commodity}





\paragraph{Option 2: reserve commodities as a special type of commodity}
